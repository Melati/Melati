<H1><TT>org.melati</TT> Internals Description
    (document $Revision$)</H1>

<P>
  This document provides a description of anything noteworthy in the
  workings of the system.  See also the system's
  <A HREF=QA.html>master QA document</A>.
</P>




<H2>
<!-- ************* -->
      Foundations
<!-- ************* -->
</H2>



<H3>
<!-- ================================== -->
      Global data structure and format
<!-- ================================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  The fundamental data structures used in the system are:
</P>

<P>
  <I> ... data dictionary; content management of static web pages;
  admin configuration</I>
</P>



<H3>
<!-- ============= -->
      Data access
<!-- ============= -->
</H3>

<P>
  The interface through which the code accesses the data is:
</P>

<P>
  ...
</P>



<H3>
<!-- ===================== -->
      Pervasive libraries
<!-- ===================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  The libraries that underpin large parts of the project are:
</P>

<P>
  ... <I>the litmus test is ``Will I have to change vast
  amounts of other code if I change this?''</I>
</P>



<H3>
<!-- =========================== -->
      Pervasive graphic designs
<!-- =========================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  The graphic designs that have wide implications for the
  layout of the system's interfaces are:
</P>

<P>
  ...
</P>



<H2><A NAME=sub-parts>
<!-- *********** -->
      Sub-parts
<!-- *********** -->
</A></H2>

<P>
  The parts into which the system naturally falls are:
</P>

<P>
  ... <I>minimise the ``surface'' area of interface; make each piece
  doable by at most two developers; describe the interface it offers
  and the other parts it relies on; include graphics designs</I>
</P>



<H3><A NAME=dsd-proc>
<!-- ===================================== -->
      Data structure definition processor
<!-- ===================================== -->
</A></H3>


<H4>
<!-- -------- -->
      Parser
<!-- -------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  The <A HREF=FunctionalSpecification.html#dsd-example>language</A> is simple.
  The only wrinkle is that the definitions are recursive.  So we use a simple
  custom top-down parser (with, obviously, Java's library tokenizer).
</P>


<H4>
<!-- ----------------------- -->
      Base class generation
<!-- ----------------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  The auto-generated base classes for the business objects wrapping the table
  rows are quite simple, because most of the logic of fetching and interpreting
  table rows sits in the <TT>Table</TT> itself (including invalidation of
  cached rows when the schema is changed).
</P>

<P>
  It probably doesn't matter if the programmer is allowed to provide their own
  <TT>getCanRead</TT>, <TT>getCanWrite</TT> methods?
</P>


<H4>
<!-- ------------------------------- -->
      Database structure generation
<!-- ------------------------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Some more auto-generated code needs to describe the minimum database scheme
  the app expects to find, including indexes.
</P>



<H3>
<!-- =========================== -->
      Transactions and cacheing
<!-- =========================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  Transactions and cacheing are handled at the level of the raw data,
  underneath the access control and object logic layer (for which see <A
  HREF=record-layer>below</A>).
</P>



<H3>
<!-- ================================= -->
      Access control and object logic
<!-- ================================= -->
</H3>

<P>
  Every object handle is authenticated for a given user.
</P>



<H3>
<!-- ================================= -->
      Runtime of the persistent store
<!-- ================================= -->
</H3>


<H4>
<!-- ---------------- -->
      Representation
<!-- ---------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Each table row is meant to be represented by a single <TT>Record</TT> object;
  contextual information which can affect the results of accesses to its
  fields, such as the user's access token and the transaction relative to which
  she is working, are encoded in the running thread.
</P>

<P>
  The actual data can very between different concurrent transactions if one is
  uncommitted.  Each version could be stored most cheaply as an
  <TT>Object[]</TT>, but we choose instead to wrap them up in a <TT>Row</TT>
  object for the reasons explained in <TT>Row.java</TT>.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- ------------------------------------ -->
    Non-uniqueness of <TT>Record</TT>s
<!-- ------------------------------------ -->
</H4>

<P>
  However, it's not quite quite possible in Java 1.1 to guarantee that a row
  won't sometimes get two <TT>Record</TT> handles.  After the following
  sequence of events&nbsp;...
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> some application code <I>c</I> asks for a certain row
  <LI> the row is loaded into the cache and a <TT>Record</TT> <I>r</I> created
       for it
  <LI> <I>r</I> is passed back to <I>c</I>
  <LI> <I>r</I> is deleted from the cache because of some other activity
  <LI> <I>c</I> asks for the same row again
  <LI> because the row is now absent from the cache again, it is loaded once
       more and a new <TT>Record</TT> <I>r'</I> is created for it
  <LI> <I>r'</I> is passed back to <I>c</I>
</UL>

<P>
  ...&nbsp;<I>c</I> has two different references to the same object.  Of this
  situation is going to be uncommon, but the only way to avoid it would be to
  use weak pointers (oh, alright then, `<TT>SoftReference</TT>s') to allow
  objects to be marked as purgeable from the cache but still stay alive until
  there were known to be no references to them left.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- ----------- -->
      The cache
<!-- ----------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  <FONT COLOR=red>What happens if the administrator changes the database while
  a write is being prepared?  It needs to fail.  E.g. enumeration of generic
  fields can produce odd results in this case.</FONT>
</P>

<P>
  We know everything that can possibly have changed in a session, since we
  forbid SQL <TT>UPDATE</TT>s which are not mediated through setter methods.
  So everything that comes in from the database and is not already in the
  session cache can go straight into the committed cache.  NB---just bear in
  mind that new <TT>Row</TT>s mustn't exist in the committed cache until the
  session in which they are created is committed.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- --------------- -->
      Access checks
<!-- --------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Hmmm, it's necessary that the programmer's overriding <TT>assertReadable</TT>
  / <TT>assertWriteable</TT> should be run with maximal permissions.
  Alternatively, we could provide <TT>protected</TT> check-free versions of
  the getter methods---but then the programmer's utility methods would have to
  come in check-free versions as well.
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> application code calls <TT>getObject("foo")</TT>
  <LI> the name is mapped: <TT>getObject(7)</TT>
  <LI> the number is mapped: <TT>getFoo()</TT>
  <LI> the programmer's one calls <TT>super.getFoo()</TT>
  <LI> it calls: <TT>_getObject(7)</TT>
    <UL>
      <LI> that calls: <TT>assertReadable()</TT>
      <LI> which determines the access token
      <LI> and calls <TT>assertReadable(token)</TT> as root
      <LI> the programmer's one calls <TT>super.assertReadable(token)</TT>
      <LI> it determines the <TT>canRead</TT> capability (which doesn't
	   recursively trigger access checks because it's running as root)
      <LI> and checks that <TT>accessToken</TT> carries <TT>canRead</TT> 
    </UL>
  <LI> and then <TT>rowUnprotected</TT>
  <LI> which retrieves the row from the session or the committed cache
  <LI> field 7 is extracted and converted
</UL>

<P>
  This all begins to put the potential inefficiency of
  <TT>token.givesCapability(canRead)</TT> into perspective.
</P>

<P>
  There is the option, for the future, of providing a `handle' which doesn't
  have to do an access check for every single `read'.  Or, we go back to the
  idea of providing <TT>getFoo_opaque</TT>, <TT>getFoo_write</TT> and
  <TT>getFoo</TT> (for read access).  Can we alternatively cache one or two
  access tokens which are known to have the appropriate capabilities?
</P>

<P>
  Alternative: specialise every handle you pass out specialised to a particular
  <TT>AccessToken</TT>.  Mark it with the permissions (on first need?).  Check
  that the thread is carrying that token, and that it hasn't been revoked (if
  indeed that's possible), but no more is required.  Have the handle carry its
  own values (when they're changed), and add a <TT>commit</TT> and an
  <TT>update</TT>.  Consequences:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> more garbage collection
  <LI> less checking (in fact very little)
  <LI> no problem with batching writes, since that's done explicitly---ACTUALLY
       we can put off all writes until a (non-committed) session is committed
       if we like?
  <LI> loss of equality testing/simple <TT>synchroniz</TT>ation (might be
       sensible to check for that, actually, and warn---easy at runtime using
       reflection)
</UL>

<P>
  Perhaps we offer this as a possibility?  If people want to do a number of
  batched writes, or they want to read a lot of fields from a snapshot of a
  record, they say

  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
// Whatever fields the template reads (from the invoice as such),
// no further (expensive) access or session checks will be done.

template.context.put("invoice", invoice.snapshotRead());
  </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

  or

  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
InvoiceSnapshot invoiceSnapshot = invoice.snapshotReadWrite();
invoiceSnapshot.setTaxDate(inputs.get("taxDate"));
invoiceSnapshot.setReceiver(inputs.get("receiver"));
invoiceSnapshot.fixate();
  </PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<P>
  One problem is that any method on a programmer-subclassed object can have
  unpredictable side effects, including for instance reads and/or writes on
  linked objects.  This means that a snapshot `set' method may have an effect
  on non-snapshots, unless we say that snapshot objects call up their own
  snapshots when links are followed.  Perhaps it's better to say: we simply
  don't write down changes made in a non-committing session unless asked.  We
  simply leave all the changes in the cache until commit time.  But it's still
  nice to use snapshot objects to avoid doing endless access checks.
</P>

<P>
  The master <TT>Record</TT> caches the session information.  The slave
  <TT>Record</TT>s cache the authentication information for a single
  <TT>AccessToken</TT>.

  Need to be able to: select themselves out of the db with a prepared
  statement; trigger to be changed when a field of a record is changed.
