<section name=" Working with Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) ">
<p>
The <it>'flexibility'</it> afforded by working with Plain Old Java Objects is bought at a price, 
namely the use of introspection. 
</p>
<p>
The use of a system such as POEM has the disadvantage that, due to Java's lack of multiple inheritance, 
you have used your one opportunity to inherit.
</p>
<p>
If POJOs can be avoided, and you are happy to use <tt>Persistents</p> as your base class then that is 
the best way to use POEM however if you want to POEM enables you to persist a POJO Object graph to a database, 
which can be useful for reporting, migrating to POEM or as your main persistance mechanism.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Hibernate</th><th>POEM</th></tr>
<tr><td>Requires a noArg constructor</td>                         <td>Yes</td><td>Yes</tr>
<tr><td>Setters and getters must be public</td>                   <td>No</td><td>Yes</tr> 
<tr><td>Persist public fields</td>                                <td>Not by default</td><td>No</tr>
<tr><td>Use existing id fields</td>                               <td>Yes</td><td>No</tr> 
<tr><td>Fields must have both a setter and a getter</td>          <td>Not sure</td><td></td>yes</tr>
</table>
<p>
POEM enforces Hibernate best practice, except we do not believe that POEM's Id field should rely upon any existing 
Id field, so if your POJO has a field called <tt>id</tt> then the troid column name will be <tt>poemId</tt> and 
your <tt>id</tt> field will be used as a normal field. One assumes that the underlying database will plan queries effectively.
