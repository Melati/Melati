<p>
To use POEM you need to have write access to your database.
POEM is very well behaved and leaves no trace of its interaction, 
other than its metadata tables,
but you may feel that creating tables in your database is too much.
</p>
<p>
POEM gathers information about your database and stores that information 
in the following tables:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>tableinfo</tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt>columninfo</tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt>tablecategory</tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt>group</tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt>user</tt>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A <tt>CourteousPoemDatabase</tt> deletes these tables during shutdown. 
You may have used POEM to modify the database, but you do not need to 
perform the cleanup step of removing the temporary metadata tables. 
</p>
<p>
After you have accessed a database with POEM then it is no longer pristine, 
the possibility of it havintg been altered still remains, 
not least by your applicatrion, but there will not be a bunch of 
POEM specific new tables let behind.
