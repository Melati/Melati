Hello,

The scripts in this directory provide a means of building melati 
and poem using Ant. 
Whilst this works, Melati is normally built using Maven. 

The original ant script was written by kimptoc@techie.com.

HOW TO USE

You need a modern version of ant (1.5 or higher).

If you just type ant you will be given a list of available options. 

To build a distributable copy of Melati just type:

ant build

It will create a directory
   .../dist/ in which the distribution is created.

To run the Melati site on the jetty webserver type:

ant run 

and point your browser at http://localhost:8080/

or to do both just type:

ant go

RELATIONSHIP to MAVEN

We now use Maven http://maven.apache.org/ though are currently still 
using V1.

The public versions of the site are all pointing to the 
Maven generated site. 
These scripts are left here for the convenience of those who use them, 
but they are deprecated and not what drives http://melati.org


MAKING A RELEASE

Once you have the scripts working there are a few things you should do
to create a release:

1.  Change the version number and date in build.xml
1a. Remove SNAPSHOT from currentVersion in ../project.xml 
    and increment it. 
2.  If your change requires upgrade action by the user make a note
    in the Upgrading section of melati/README.html
3.  Change Last Updated and Updated By and add a new paragraph to 
    melati/RELEASE-NOTES.html
4.  Add a paragraph about this release to melati/site/docsrc/Releases.ahtml
    Update melati/site/docsrc/Download.ahtml
    Review melati/site/docsrc/Roadmap.ahtml
5.  CVS commit all of the above
    except project.xml
6.  CVS tag this release (cvs tag Melati-0-7-5)
9.  Test everything
10. Commit project.xml to initiate a maven build on the server
11. On rama:
    cd /dist/melati
    cvs update
    cd build 
    ant build
12. Copy downloadable  jars and zips to 
    cp dist/packaged/*.* /dist/melati/download/
13. Update sourceforge
cvs -z3 -d:ext:developername@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/melati co melati
cvs -d:ext:developername@melati.org:/usr/cvsroot export melati
cvs commit
