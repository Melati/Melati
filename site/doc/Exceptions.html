<P>
  Not everyone likes the convention of making everything a
  <TT>RuntimeException</TT>!

<P>
  Rendering exceptions using templets does seem to be the way to go, especially
  since it provides a solution in principle to the problem of supporting
  different locales/markup languages.

<H2>
<!-- ********************* -->
      Context information
<!-- ********************* -->
</H2>

<P>
  The mechanism for attaching contextual information to exceptions as they find
  their way up the stack has some disadvantages: we are wrapping the original
  exception in a "more general one" as it comes past.  Although this does
  provide an obvious place to attach context info, it does make it harder to
  net the original exception in a <TT>catch</TT> clause.
</P>

<P>
  It might be better to attach context info explicitly in a <TT>Stack</TT> of
  <TT>ExceptionContext</TT>s.  These could have their own templets.
