INTRODUCTION

Hello,

The scripts in this directory provide a means of building melati and poem using the Ant makefiles.

You will be able to generate a tar and zip file that contains the complete software needed to use melati and or poem.


If you have any problems with this, please let me know - kimptoc@techie.com

Make sure you know how to use Ant in general - see - http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html

Have fun,
Chris


HOW TO USE

To build a distributable copy of Melati, under unix, just use 

   sh build-melati.sh

It will create a directory
   .../snapshot/ which contains:

melati-snapshot.tar
melati-snapshot.tar.gz
melati-snapshot.tar.zip

these files contain all the sources, the java docs and the other misc files associated with melati.


To build a jar file of all Melati code, under unix, just use 
   sh build-melati.sh jar

Assuming you have melati installed in a directory like 
    .../src/org/melati/...

It will create a directory
   .../dist/

Which will contain all the compiled classes, and additional files (*.wm, *.html, *.gif and *.js)

And a directory
   .../built/

Which will contain the melati jar file.  a zip file of the sources, 
and additional files (*.wm, *.html, *.gif and *.js)



To just compile the code, but not generate the jar file
   sh build-melati.sh compile


To generate the javadoc report
   sh build-melati.sh javadocs


To remove all the compiled code and generated jar files
   sh build-melati.sh clean


NOTE
The above assumed you were working on unix... 
There is a also a build-melati.bat script that works on NT - although it has not been tested (VOLUNTEERS?)
