/**
 * This example demonstrates using WebMacro in "standalone" mode. 
 * Instead of subclassing from WMServlet you create and maintain 
 * your own WebMacro object
 * and you are free to subclass from another servlet. 
 * Also, this technique can be used outside the servlet context.
 * <p>
 * The WebMacro master object is initialized when the servlet is initialized
 * and destroyed when the servlet is destroyed. There is some overhead 
 * involved in creating the interface so you should prefer not to create one
 * on every request, although it is not too expensive. 
 * <p>
 * This servlet can be compiled and installed as an ordinary servlet. You 
 * need to ensure that your WebMacro.properties file is properly configured
 * and available on your CLASSPATH. When setting up WebMacro.properties 
 * make sure that the TemplatePath is correctly set and that the template
 * used by this servlet, "standalone.wm", is available on that path.

   /**
     * We only implement the GET method in this servlet. 
     * <p>
     * We create a WebContext object, populate it with some data, select
     * a template, and write the output of that template to the output 
     * stream. Note that you need to pass the WebContext object to the 
     * template in order to write it, you also need an output stream, in
     * this case the HttpServletResponse output stream is used. 
     * <p>
     * If you were using WebMacro outside a servlet context you would not
     * be able to construct a WebContext object, since you would not have 
     * the HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects which you 
     * need in order to do that. WebContext is a subclass of Context, so 
     * outside of a servlet just construct a TemplateContext object. You will 
     * obviously lose the ability to talk about servlet specific things 
     * in your templates (such as "Cookies") but otherwise it's the same.
     * <p>
     * There are a few exceptions you have to deal with. First, WebMacro 
     * may not be able to locate the template you've requested in which 
     * case it'll throw a NotFoundException. Second, the template will 
     * expect to find certain information in the TemplateContext, and if you fail 
     * to provide that information a ContextException will be thrown. Aside
     * than WebMacro, in a servlet environment you also have to deal with 
     * the IOException that can be thrown if something goes wrong with 
     * the network connection back to the client.
