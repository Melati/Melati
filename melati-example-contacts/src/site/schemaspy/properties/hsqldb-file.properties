# connection spec
#  text between <>'s will be prompted for on the command line
#    e.g. if <param> is in connectionSpec then you must have -param on the command line
#  if you're missing a required parameter then you're be prompted with the text
#  that's associated with that paramter
#    e.g. missing -dir then you'll be prompted for 'directory containing db (with initial slash and without terminal slash)'
# expected format: jdbc:hsqldb:/<dir>/<db>
connectionSpec=jdbc:hsqldb:<dir>/<db>
dir=directory containing db (with initial slash and without terminal slash)

# if your driver returns failures like "stream already closed" then its metadata
# services probably aren't thread safe and you'll have to uncomment this line
# or specify "-dbThreads 1" on the command line.
