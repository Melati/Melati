      Introduction

<H3>
<!-- ===================== -->
      What is Melati for?
<!-- ===================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  Melati is an open source, Java-based infrastructure for the rapid and
  convenient development of web-based database applications.  It addresses the
  following problems typically encountered in the development of complex sites:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B>Separating design from logic</B>
       <P>
         Melati is based on the popular <A
         HREF=http://webmacro.org>Webmacro</A> templating system, which allows
         for a clean divide between the HTML (WML, ...) page design and the
         program.
       </P>

  <LI> <B>Getting database fields on and off web pages</B>
       <P>
	 Melati can render both field values and input controls such as
	 <TT>&lt;INPUT&gt;</TT>s and <TT>&lt;SELECT&gt;</TT>s automatically,
	 using JDBC field information enriched with web-settable preferences.
	 It also adds Javascript triggers for validating input values on the
	 client side before submission, according to the fields' types.  Links
	 between related fields are resolved transparently, so that they seem
	 like Java references.  <FONT COLOR=red>Alpha-ready, but we need to
	 port JAL's nifty system of date dropdowns.</FONT>
       </P>

  <LI> <B>Administering database content</B>
       <P>
	 Melati offers a generic database admin system which allows editing of
	 both the contents and (soon) the structure of any part of the
	 database, without the need for customised admin pages: data entry and
	 editing &quot;out of the box&quot;, just like you get with desktop
	 database packages.  <FONT COLOR=red>Close to alpha-ready; it's just a
	 matter of working up the missing screens and making it prettier.
	 E.g. one of the other Paneris people who contributed to JAL will be
	 able to help me on this one.</FONT>
       </P>

  <LI> <B>Managing users and their access permissions</B>
       <P>
	 All database accesses made through Melati are subjected to low-level
	 checks via a user/group/capability mechanism, configurable by the
	 administrator.  <FONT COLOR=red>Alpha-ready, but not yet integrated
	 into the servlet user-session system.</FONT>
       </P>

  <LI> <B>Expressing business logic cleanly</B>
       <P>
	 Melati's easy-to-use persistence mechanism can present a predefined
	 subset of the database to the programmer as a collection of Java
	 objects, with typed <TT>set</TT>/<TT>get</TT> methods, which happen to
	 store their state in the database, allowing her to express the
	 application logic in a much more natural way than she could using JDBC
	 directly.  Each Java thread (such as that processing a servlet
	 request) is associated with a different concurrent database
	 transaction, and runs with different access permissions depending on
	 the user on whose behalf it is working.
         <FONT COLOR=red>Alpha-ready.</FONT>
       </P>

  <LI> <B>Cacheing frequently-used table rows</B>
       <P>
	 Intensively-used tables can be transparently cached on a
	 least-recently-used basis (and the cache behaves correctly with
	 respect to transactions).  <FONT COLOR=red>Alpha-ready.</FONT>
       </P>
</UL>

      Melati POEM (Persistent Object Engine For Melati) is what gives Melati
      its object-oriented view of the underlying relational database.  It
      maintains type information about database fields, and handles connection
      pooling, cacheing and access control.  POEM is independent of the rest of
      Melati and could be used for non-web applications.  Of interest to
      programmers.

      POEM's preprocessor is responsible for turning concise, Java-style
      &quot;Data Structure Definitions&quot; into boilerplate code for creating
      a corresponding relational database and representing it as a collection
      of typed objects.  Of interest to programmers.

      Melati's interface with Webmacro exploits the rationalised view of the
      RDBMS offered by POEM to automate the process of generating views and
      inputs for fields and rows.  Of interest to page authors.
