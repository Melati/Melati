<H1>org.melati Related Products Report (document $Revision$)</H1>

<P>
  This document describes products related to the one proposed, with a view to
  identifying libraries it could reuse and/or usefully interoperate with,
  threats to its marketability, and wheels in which it is in danger of
  reinventing.  See also the system's <A HREF=QA.html>master QA document</A>.

      Scope

<P>
  No claim of exhaustiveness or even accuracy is made for this review in its
  current form, which is based on about six hours' work summarising what we
  (believe we) know about products we happen to have noticed over time, the
  contents of some likely looking freshmeat categories, and the current state
  of the <TT>java.apache.org</TT> projects.  It's also a bit scrappy, but I
  don't want to spend too much time on this unless we find it raises serious
  questions about the way we are going.

<H4><A NAME=Turbine>
<!-- --------- -->
      Turbine
<!-- --------- -->
</A></H4>

<P>
  <A HREF=http://java.apache.org/turbine/index.html>Turbine</A> appears to
  help with the following things:

  <UL>
    <LI> URL-independent `actions', specified by CGI fields
    <LI> high-level page layout, with `navigation' panels
    <LI> user and access control list management, with user objects stored in
         a database via the <A HREF=#OPL>OPL</A> persistence mechanism
    <LI> utilities (basically, database connection pooling)
  </UL>
</P>

<P>
  It's intended basically to work with <A HREF=#ECS>ECS</A>:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The design of Turbine is based around the idea that a developer can remain in
  the Java language without having to learn or switch to XML/XSL/XSP or other
  template languages (ie: WebMacro and FreeMarker) in order to achieve the Html
  and Logic abstraction that template based web application websites require.
  [<TT>java.apache.org/turbine/index.html</TT>]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  But you can write your own `Screen' module, which could involve instantiating
  a webmacro template.
</P>

<P>
  There is also a suggestion that you might like to use <A HREF=#OPL>OPL</A>
  in order to
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  abstract the database accesses so that all you need to do is pass in a
  Criteria object and execute <TT>doInsert()</TT>, <TT>doSelect()</TT>,
  <TT>doUpdate()</TT> or <TT>doDelete()</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  However, OPL is not a necessary or tightly-integrated part of Turbine.
</P>

<P>
  The main points of interest in Turbine are
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> its facilities for user management/access control: each user is
       assigned a `role' (such as `Administrator', `User Level 2' <I>etc.</I>)
       which carries a set of permissions (such as `can upload file of size
       ...'); this is not very different from the Unix user/group/permission
       system, but is less flexible than what is proposed for Melati, and
       appears not to support low-level guards on data access in any convenient
       way
  <LI> its use of a persistent store; but see the <A HREF=#OPL>comments about
       OPL, below</A>
</UL>

<P>
  Its other features are not of interest to us, since they conflict with our
  philosophy of thoroughgoing templating.  The URL-independent `actions' would
  seem not to carry any particular benefit: as timj points out, ``If common
  funcationality (get a db connection etc) is required between servelts, then
  we should subclass the base servlet.''
</P>


<H4><A NAME=ECS>
<!-- ----- -->
      ECS
<!-- ----- -->
</A></H4>

<P>
  To quote from <A HREF=http://java.apache.org/ecs>ECS</A>'s documentation:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The Element Construction Set is designed from the bottom up to be an object 
  oriented abstraction of tag generation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  It means everything from the <TT>&lt;HTML&gt;</TT> tag down, which sets most
  of it squarely at odds with our philosophy that HTML isn't all that difficult
  and templating is a better way to go.  Even with tags that Melati must know
  how to generate, such as form fields, it's not clear how much effort we will
  save by reusing or adapting the relevant parts of ECS, especially when one
  considers that part of the point of Melati is to support persistent default
  field rendering preferences.
</P>


<H4><A NAME=OPL>
<!-- ----- -->
      OPL
<!-- ----- -->
</A></H4>

<P>
  OPL is an object/RDBMS interface patterned after a
  `<A HREF=http://www.ambysoft.com/persistenceLayer.html>white paper</A>' by
  someone called Scott W. Ambler of Ambysoft, and included as
  <TT>java.org.apache.turbine.opl</TT> in the Turbine distribution.
</P>

<P>
  Turbine uses OPL for persistent storage of user information, via
  <TT>org.apache.turbine.util.TurbineUser</TT> and <TT>.TurbineUserPeer</TT>.
</P>

<P>
  From a brief examination of the source for those classes and of the white
  paper and OPL sources, it appears that OPL is substantially more complex for
  the programmer than it is envisaged that Melati should be: It does not go
  all-out for the illusion of being an ODMS built into the language, so that
  table rows appear as similar as possible to other objects.  The programmer
  must explicitly define a <TT>retrieveFromStorage</TT>/<TT>saveToStorage</TT>
  pair---and call them as necessary; the examples that follow are taken from
  Turbine's <TT>User</TT> object:
</P>

<PRE>
    public User retrieveFromStorage( Integer visitorid ) throws Exception
    {
        Criteria criteria = new Criteria(); 
        criteria.put( TurbineUserPeer.VISITOR_ID, visitorid );
        Vector users = TurbineUserPeer.doSelect(criteria);
        if ( users.size() &gt; 1 ) 
        {
            throw new Exception("Multiple Users with same visitorid");
        }
        if ( users.size() == 1 ) 
        {
            return (User) users.firstElement();
        }
        return null;
    }

    public void saveToStorage() throws Exception
    {
        // this is where we should save the permStorage hashtable
        // to the database if we can get a connection to the database
        // First any hashtable entries which have a column assigned
        // are placed for storage in their respective column.
            Hashtable permData = (Hashtable) getPermStorage().clone();
            Criteria criteria = new Criteria();
            criteria.add( TurbineUserPeer.VISITOR_ID, getId() );                 

            for (int i=1; i&lt;TurbineUserPeer.columnNames.length; i++ )
            {
                if ( permData.containsKey(TurbineUserPeer.criteriaKeys[i]) )
                {
                    criteria.add( TurbineUserPeer.criteriaKeys[i], 
                        permData.remove(TurbineUserPeer.criteriaKeys[i]) );
                }
            }
            criteria.add( TurbineUserPeer.OBJECT_DATA, permData );            
            TurbineUserPeer.doUpdate(criteria);
    }
</PRE>

<P>
  See also <TT>TurbineUserPeer</TT>, which is a little under 300 lines long
  (its superclass <TT>org.apache.turbine.util.db.BasePeer</TT>, while not part
  of the OPL package, appears to be non-Turbine-specific generic code).  In
  <TT>org.apache.turbine.opl.examples.EmployeeClassMap</TT> the following
  comment is made: ``in the future all map info will be read from an XML file
  or a Database.  this area needs alot more work.''
</P>

<P>
  In Melati, by contrast, the intention is that the programmer need only provide
  a high-level description of the database structure, the details of
  marshalling and unmarshalling being hidden in automatically generated code
  (and/or introspection).  As in the <A HREF=#GJD>Groovy Java Database</A>
  ODBMS, she can treat persistent objects as objects which happen to persist
  from session to session.
</P>

<P>
  Another source of complexity in OPL is that it provides an abstraction layer
  over SQL, in the form of <TT>PersistentCriteria</TT> objects, which map
  pretty straightforwardly onto SQL <TT>WHERE</TT> clauses, and
  <TT>PersistentTransaction</TT> objects, which reify an SQL transaction as a
  list of tasks to be performed.  These features offer some benefits: it is
  possible to embed <TT>WHERE</TT> clauses in Java in a way which avoids most
  of the danger of making typos in literal SQL, and it is possible to write a
  backend for the system from scratch without it having to understand SQL.  A
  `abstract SQL' notation is under consideration for Melati, but we may well
  conclude that the extra complexity and computational overhead it adds
  outweigh its advantages.  And Melati is designed to follow the SQL model of
  transactions---<I>i.e.</I> leaving them implicit, associated with a
  <TT>Connection</TT> (which could also be called a `session')---which is
  arguably less intrusive and more intuitive.
</P>

<P>
  Note that OPL's reification of SQL <TT>UPDATE</TT> and <TT>DELETE</TT>
  operations does not, in fact, offer any performance benefit over a more
  transparent ODBMS-style `select objects, then modify each in turn' idiom when
  dealing with large numbers of table rows, because, as Ambler points out in
  his `white paper', it's necessary to instantiate each row as a Java object
  before it is modified in case a Java method has been defined which does
  something special on update.
</P>

<P>
  OPL appears not to be capable of cacheing data.  Cacheing of very frequently
  used data such as metadata, `enumeration type' lookup tables and localisation
  phrases is considered a requirement for Melati.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- -------- -->
      Cocoon
<!-- -------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  <A HREF=http://xml.apache.org/cocoon>Cocoon</A> is a framework for flexible
  server-side XML-to-HTML, WML, <I>etc.</I> instantiation.  It can be
  integrated with an arbitrary XML-generating backend by plugging in
  programmer-defined `Producer' (as defined in the <A
  HREF=http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/guide.html>user guide</A>).  However, we
  seem more keen to go with the idea of relatively pure (webmacro) templates
  written directly to use the target markup language, rather than XML plus XSL.
</P>


<H4><A NAME=SPFC>
<!-- ------ -->
      SPFC
<!-- ------ -->
</A></H4>

<P>
  <A HREF=http://java.apache.org/spfc/index.html>SPFC</A> (Server Pages
  Foundation Classes) has two aims.
</P>

<P>
  The first, more mundane, goal is to help programmers avoid writing literal
  HTML in Java by providing the obvious kind of objects representing forms
  <I>etc.</I> which can be rendered into HTML once their properties have been
  set.  This is clearly something Melati needs, but only at the level of the
  individual widgets---since everything else is implemented through templating.
  Melati also has quite particular requirements for implementing persistent
  default display preferences for fields and widgets, which will be supported
  most cleanly by binding them quite tightly with the persistence mechanism, so
  it isn't clear that this part of SPFC has much to offer.  (<I>Cf.</I> the <A
  HREF=#ECS>remarks above about ECS</A>---the two projects apparently do not
  fit together or share code.)
</P>

<P>
  The second facility SPFC provides is potentially much more interesting: it
  helps turn the transactional, stateless logic of multi-page browser-server
  interation around and allow you to program in a more natural manner.  More
  evaluation will be required before we can decide whether this is really
  useful, and compatible with our wish to use templates intensively.
</P>

<P>
  SPFC is currently very much in early development (see the <A
  HREF=http://java.apache.org/spfc/dist>download page</A>).
</P>


<H3><A NAME=GJB>
<!-- ====================== -->
      Groovy Java Database
<!-- ====================== -->
</A></H3>

<P>
  <A HREF=http://www.linuxstart.com/~groovyjava/Database>Groovy Java
  Database</A> is a true ODBMS for Java.  It works very much in the way
  envisaged for Melati, except that it uses a flat file for storing all data in
  (by default) Java's native serialisation format, and keeps indexes in memory
  as Java data structures.  You write simple and elegant code and get
  persistence almost for free: it is a good demonstration of how much more
  straightforward persistence can seem to the programmer than it does in the
  model apparently adopted by <A HREF=#OPL>OPL</A>.  However, the difference in
  the form of the backing store and the fact that GJB doesn't support access
  control or (yet, it seems) transactions means that there is little to be
  gained by taking anything from it except ideas.
</P>


<H3>
<!-- ========================== -->
      Application servers, etc.
<!-- ========================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  This stuff is VERY brief.  I (williamc) would appreciate people expanding on
  it where they think important things are missing.  I haven't bothered with
  commercial application servers.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- ---------- -->
      Webmacro
<!-- ---------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Webmacro, which we have used a lot and like, could almost be considered as an
  application server and is certainly one of the more widely used Java
  templating systems.
</P>


<H4><A NAME=Zope>
<!-- ------ -->
      Zope
<!-- ------ -->
</A></H4>

<P>
  Zope is an application server with considerable mindshare at least on the
  Linux news sites.  But it has various apparent disadvantages, such as a
  deviant programming language (Python), a strange templating system, and
  remarkably profuse and obscure hype/documentation.  We could look more
  closely at it to see if there are any good ideas we should learn from.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- ------------- -->
      PHP/Midgard
<!-- ------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  PHP suffers, IIRC, from you having to put all the code in the templates in a
  vaguly Perlish scripting language, which suggests that it is targeted at
  people with different requirements from us who don't want to treat pages as
  views onto OO-modelled data (`business objects').
</P>

<P>
  <A HREF=http://www.midgard-project.org/article/884.html>Midgard</A> is built
  on PHP and seems to be aimed at helping to administer large tree-structured
  sites with relatively uncomplicated DB requirements.  Its handling of user
  accounts/access control may deserve a closer look.  Currently you have to use
  MySQL, implying that it doesn't support transactions.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- ---------- -->
      ASP, JSP
<!-- ---------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Noone with any taste seems to like these, but I (williamc) don't know
  anything about them really.
</P>

<!-- ************ -->
      Discussion
<!-- ************ -->
</H2>

<P>
  My (williamc's) tentative conclusions after a brief run through
  <TT>java.apache.org</TT> are:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> There are one or two nice ideas floating around, such as <A
       HREF=#SPFC>SPFC</A>'s rationalisation of navigation logic.

  <LI> Some of the projects might be useful if we shared their aim of not
       writing any HTML---but we have decided that templating in the target
       markup language is a good way to go.

  <LI> The <A HREF=#OPL>OPL</A> persistence mechanism associated with <A
       HREF=#Turbine>Turbine</A> appears not to have been done very well.
       I think I would rather use raw <TT>ResultSet</TT>s.

  <LI> Otherwise, nothing is on offer which we don't get from webmacro or
       haven't done better in JAL already.
</UL>

<P>
  In short, I can perceive no benefit even in aiming for compatibility with any
  <TT>java.apache.org</TT> products.  Perhaps this assessment is too cruel:
  it's open to revision!
</P>

<P>
  Looking more broadly, I couldn't see anything which offers anything
  approximating the combination of features present in JAL and proposed for
  Melati, namely
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> Java programming
  <LI> generic DB administration, with field display preferences
  <LI> convenient semi-ODBMS view of the database, with cacheing
  <LI> immediate and convenient templating
