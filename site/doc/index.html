<!-- ************** -->
      Introduction
<!-- ************** -->
</H2>



<H3>
<!-- ===================== -->
      What is Melati for?
<!-- ===================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  Melati is an open source, Java-based infrastructure for the rapid and
  convenient development of web-based database applications.  It addresses the
  following problems typically encountered in the development of complex sites:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> <B>Separating design from logic</B>
       <P>
         Melati was influenced in its development by the ground-breaking 
         <A
         HREF="http://webmacro.org">Webmacro</A> templating system, which allows
         for a clean divide between the HTML (WML, ...) page design and the
         program.
       </P>
       <P>
         Since <a hre="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/">Velocity</a> 
         has arrived Melati has become template engine agnostic.
         It works with all versions of Velocity and was shown to work with a 
         home grown templating engine (Jtemplater).
       </P>
       <p>
         Melati fits into and encourages a Model / Controller / View (MVC) 
         approach to systems design. 
       </p>
  <LI> <B>Getting database fields on and off web pages</B>
       
    <P> Melati can render both field values and input controls such as <TT>&lt;INPUT&gt;</TT>s 
      and <TT>&lt;SELECT&gt;</TT>s automatically, using JDBC field information 
      enriched with web-settable preferences. It also adds Javascript triggers 
      for validating input values on the client side before submission, according 
      to the fields' types. Links between related fields are resolved transparently, 
      so that they seem like Java references. </P>

  <LI> <B>Administering database content</B>
       
    <P> Melati offers a generic database admin system which allows searching/browsing 
      of any table, and editing of both the contents and the structure of any 
      part of the database, without the need for customised admin pages: data 
      entry and editing &quot;out of the box&quot;, just like you get with desktop 
      database packages. </P>

  <LI> <B>Managing users and their access permissions</B>
       
    <P> All database accesses made through Melati are subjected to low-level checks 
      via a user/group/capability mechanism, configurable by the administrator. 
      Either cookies or HTTP Basic Authentication (the mechanism commonly used 
      for password protection of static pages) can be used to maintain the user 
      ID in a session. </P>

  <LI> <B>Expressing business logic cleanly</B>
       
    <P> Melati's easy-to-use persistence mechanism can present a predefined subset 
      of the database to the programmer as a collection of Java objects, with 
      statically typed <TT>set</TT>/<TT>get</TT> methods, which happen to store 
      their state in the database. She can add Java methods to these objects (table 
      rows), and express the application logic in a much more natural way than 
      she could using JDBC directly. </P>

  <LI> <B>Implicit transactions</B>
       
    <P> Each Java thread (such as that processing a single servlet request) is 
      associated with a different concurrent database transaction, and runs with 
      different access permissions depending on the user on whose behalf it is 
      working. </P>

  <LI> <B>Cacheing frequently-used table rows</B>
       <P>
	 Intensively-used tables can be transparently cached on a
	 least-recently-used basis (and the cache behaves correctly with
	 respect to transactions). 
       </P>

  <LI> <B>Cacheing standard queries and other database-dependent objects.</B>
       <P>
         Standard queries (including simple joins) can be transparently cached
         so that an up-to-date result is recomputed on demand.  It's easy to
         make automatically-refreshing higher-level database-dependent objects
         as well.  This cacheing mechanism is also transaction-safe!
       </P>
</UL>



<H3><A NAME=howworks>
<!-- ======================= -->
      How does Melati work?
<!-- ======================= -->
</A></H3>

<P>
  The entry points to a Melati application are a set of one or more servlets
  derived from <A
  HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/servlet/TemplateServlet.html"><TT>TemplateServlet</TT></A>.
  There are subtypes for different template engines.
  It takes care of determining the Melati username
  associated with the client, and the `logical database' on which the servlet
  should operate from the path info: for instance, the URL

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
http://melati.org/webmacro/org.melati.admin.Admin/melatitest/user/View
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  asks the
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/admin/Admin.html"><TT>Admin</TT></A>
  servlet (<A HREF="/src/org/melati//Admin.java"><TT>Admin.java</TT></A>) to
  &quot; <tt>View</tt> the
  <TT>user</TT> table of the <TT>melatitest</TT> database&quot;.  This scheme
  has the (admittedly minor) advantage that it makes possible the use of
  concise relative URLs for many purposes.
</P>

<P>
  If it has not already been encountered by the running virtual machine, the
  logical database name is mapped to JDBC connection details via the config
  file <A
  HREF="/properties/org/melati/org.melati.LogicalDatabase.properties"><TT>org.melati.LogicalDatabase.properties</TT></A>.
  When the first JDBC connection has been established (<I>i.e.</I> once per
  JVM), a picture is built up of how the structure-database ought to look,
  drawing on the programmer's compile-time <A
  HREF="PoemUserGuide.html#DSD">Data Structure Definition</A> (DSD), if
  any, and on the type-rich metadata set up by the administrator using the
  generic admin interface.  This picture is then unified, or reconciled, with
  the actual database structure reported by JDBC's <TT>DatabaseMetadata</TT>.
  In effect, the structures specified by the three sources are added together
  and merged; any tables or columns present in the underlying DBMS but not
  specified by the programmer or administrator are incorporated (and have
  default metadata records created for them), while conversely any tables or
  columns specified by the programmer or administrator but not present in the
  DBMS are created.  If the unification cannot be completed consistently
  (<I>e.g.</I> if the underlying database has been incompatibly altered), the
  connection is aborted.
</P>

<P>
  The end result of all this as far as the Java code is concerned is a natural
  and convenient representation of the database in terms of
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Database.html"><TT>Database</TT></A>,
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Table.html"><TT>Table</TT></A> and
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Column.html"><TT>Column</TT></A>
  objects.  Columns have rich
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/PoemType.html"><TT>PoemType</TT></A>
  types which include information such as the target of a reference (link)
  or the default height of a text field; but in general one works directly in
  terms of 
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Persistent.html"><TT>Persistent</TT></A> 
  objects representing the rows in the database.
</P>

<P>
  In coding up the application logic, the programmer accesses the rows' fields
  using statically named and typed methods autogenerated at compile time from
  the Data Structure Definition.  For more on this, see the
  <A HREF="PoemUserGuide.html">Melati POEM User Guide</A>.
</P>

<P>
  Template writers can simply ask for the appropriate field value and let the
  <A
  HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/template/MarkupLanguage.html"><TT>MarkupLanguage</TT></A>
  of their choice render it appropriately.  For instance, assuming that an
  application servlet has set <TT>$product</TT> to refer to some
  <TT>Persistent</TT> object, one could say
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
#set $Response.ContentType = "text/html"
#set $ml = $melati.HTMLMarkupLanguage
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
  You have asked for a $ml.rendered($product.NameField),
  which has to come from $ml.rendered($product.CountryField)
  at a cost of $ml.rendered($product.Country.PriceField).
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  The <TT>...Field</TT> idiom returns a value wrapped up with a
  <TT>PoemType</TT> which the markup language <TT>$ml</TT> (set to HTML at the
  top of the template) knows how to render.  Note the phrase
  <TT>$product.Country.PriceField</TT>, in which a reference (link) to a record
  in the <TT>country</TT> table is transparently followed.
</P>

<P>
  Generating input controls for objects' fields is just as easy.  The following
  simplified fragment of a template from the generic admin system
  (<A HREF="/src/org/melati/admin/Edit.wm">Edit.wm</A>, 
  also illustrates how you can iterate 
  over all the fields in
  an object without having to know their names:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;TABLE&gt;
  #foreach $field in $object {
    &lt;TR&gt;
      &lt;TD&gt;
        $ml.rendered($field.DisplayName)
      &lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;
        $ml.input($field)
      &lt;/TD&gt;
    &lt;/TR&gt;
  }
&lt;/TABLE&gt;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  Behind the simple phrase <TT>$ml.input($field)</TT>, Melati is
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> Inspecting the field's <TT>PoemType</TT>.
  <LI> Loading a `templet', or WebMacro mini-template, which contains the
       HTML (WML, ...) markup necessary for generating an input control for
       values of the type.  The administrator can override this and give an
       explicit name of a templet which should be used for any given field's
       values, if she wants to be able to customise it wherever it appears.
  <LI> Expanding the templet against the field.
  <LI> Interpolating it into the main template.
</UL>

<P>
  Part of the point of having type-specific templates is that they can carry
  JavaScript (VBScript, ...) routines for client-side validation of the values
  entered or otherwise selected by the user.  For instance, this is
  <A
  HREF="/src/org/melati/template/webmacro/templets/html/org.melati.poem.IntegerPoemType.wm">
<TT>
template/webmacro/templets/html/org.melati.poem.IntegerPoemType.wm
</TT></A>:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
&lt;INPUT NAME="field_$ml.rendered($field.Name)" SIZE=$field.Width
       VALUE="$ml.Attr.rendered($field.RawString)"&gt;

&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript1.2&gt;
  add_integer("field_$ml.escaped($field.Name)",
              "$ml.escaped($field.DisplayName)",
	      !$field.Type.Nullable)
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  You can see at the top and bottom of <A
	  HREF="/src/org/melati/admin/Edit.wm">Edit.wm</A> 
  how
  these JavaScript fragments fit into the overall template.
</P>

      Melati POEM (Persistent Object Engine for Melati) is what gives Melati
      its object-oriented view of the underlying relational database.  It
      maintains type information about database fields, and handles connection
      pooling, cacheing and access control.  POEM is independent of the rest of
      Melati and could be used for non-web applications.

      Melati's API is Template Engine agnostic. Melati can be used with 
      Webmacro or Velocity or both, as Webmacro templates are converted 
      on-the-fly to Velocity templates.
      <br />
      Melati comes with default templets for rendering fields for 
      input and output in HTML or WML.
      The templets can be overridden or added to.
