  We give in principle anyone who asks CVS write access. The only quality policy 
  we ask people to enforce is that committed changes should compile correctly 
  correctly, and that they should be believed to work. To make changes, please 
  follow this procedure:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Submit a Bug Report or Feature Request detailing what you plan to do/fix. 
 <li>Make changes and commit them to CVS.
 <li>Submit a Change Notice detailing what you have done. 
</ol>
