INTRODUCTION

Hello,

The scripts in this directory provide a means of building melati and poem using the Ant makefiles.

You will be able to generate a jar file that contains the complete software needed to use melati and or poem.


If you have any problems with this, please let me know - kimptoc@techie.com

Make sure you know how to use Ant in general - see - http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html

Have fun,
Chris


HOW TO USE


To build a jar file of all Melati code, under unix, just use 
   sh build-melati.sh 

Assuming you have melati installed in a directory like 
    .../src/org/melati/...

It will create a directory
   .../dist/

Which will contain all the compiled classes

And a directory
   .../lib/

Which will contain the melati jar file.



To just compile the code, but not generate the jar file
   sh build-melati.sh compile



To generate the javadoc report
   sh build-melati.sh javadocs



To remove all the compiled code and generated jar files
   sh build-melati.sh clean



NOTE
The above assumed you were working on unix... 
There is a also a build-melati.bat script that works on NT - although it has not been tested (VOLUNTEERS?)
