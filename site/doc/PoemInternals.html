<!-- ===================== -->
      The metadata tables
<!-- ===================== -->
</A></H3>

<P>
  This section describes in detail the structure of the metadata tables
  <TT>tableinfo</TT> and <TT>columninfo</TT> as an aid to the understanding
  POEM's (and the admin system's) workings, and for the benefit of anyone
  undertaking repair work on a damaged database.  For a discussion of their
  function and relationship with the DSD and the JDBC metadata, see the <A
  HREF=UserGuide.html#metadataTables>user guide</A>.
</P>

      <TT>tableinfo</TT>
<!-- -------------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  The <TT>tableinfo</TT> table describes the properties of each table in the
  database (including itself).  It comprises the following columns:
</P>

<TABLE CELLSPACING=0>
  <TR VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD><TT>id</TT></TD>
    <TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>
      Like every other record in a POEM database, each <TT>tableinfo</TT> has
      to have a troid (table row ID, or table-unique non-nullable integer
      primary key); and like the troids of other POEM special tables, this one
      is called <TT>id</TT>.  It is not related to the order in which the
      tables appear in the database, or to anything else: it's just a
      convenient arbitrary identifier for the table.
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD></TD><TD><FONT SIZE=0>&nbsp;</FONT></TD><TD></TD></TR>
  <TR VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD><TT>name</TT></TD>
    <TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>
      The programmatic name of the table, identical with its name in the DSD
      (if the table was defined there) and in the RDBMS itself.  You can't
      change this through the normal POEM channels, and if you do change it
      your application will at best fail to start next time.  So don't do that.
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD></TD><TD><FONT SIZE=0>&nbsp;</FONT></TD><TD></TD></TR>
  <TR VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD><TT>displayname</TT></TD>
    <TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>
      The descriptive name of the table.  POEM itself doesn't use this, but
      it's available to applications and Melati's generic admin system as a
      default label for the table and caption for its records.
    </TD>

  <TR VALIGN=TOP>
    <TD><TT>displayorder</TT></TD>
    <TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
    <TD>
      An integer defining where the table should appear in lists of all tables
      in the database (used by Melati's generic admin system).
