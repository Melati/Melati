<section name=" Database Design ">
<p>
Melati makes some assumptions about database design best practice.
</p>
<subsection name=" Table and Field Naming ">
<p>
Ideally database table names are all lowercase, the java class name 
will be all lowercase with first letter capitalised.
</p>
<p>
Whatever case you use in the DSD will be respected and reflected in the 
java class names, method names and database table names created.
</p>
<p>
Names cannot start with a number.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name=" Keys ">
<p>
All tables are expected to have a unique field called <tt>id</tt>, it is this field 
that is used when this record is referred to in another record.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name=" Indexing ">
<p>
All fields designated as searchable have an index created on them if they do not already have one. 
Melati assumes that the dbms will plan queries effectively using whatever keys it has available.
