<h2>What is it?</h2>
<P>
  Melati is a tool for building Java-programmed websites backed by a database. 
  It provides the following features:</P>
<ul>
  <li>a generic <B>database administration system</B>, allowing the site manager to edit 
    both the contents and the structure of the database through a simple web based 
    interface.</li>
  <li>rapid templating mechanism, using "templets" (sub-templates) for rendering 
    interface elements (eg HTML input boxes, dropdowns), and providing an easy 
    interface with persistent objects.
  <li>close integration with the <A HREF=http://www.webmacro.org>Webmacro</A> and 
  <A HREF=http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/>Velocity</a> templating 
    engines. </li>
  <li>cookie-based or HTTP-based login provoked automatically by access control 
    failure.</li>
  <li>full integration with <b>POEM</b> (Persistent Object Engine for Melati).  POEM provides
  <ul>
  <li>industrial-strength open source object database technology, delivering 
    <b>ODMG 3.0</b> compliant Java support.</li>
  <li>an API which enables the database to be seen as a collection of Java objects, 
    via a (genuinely!) easy-to-use <b>transparent persistence layer</b> on top 
    of JDBC. </li>
  <li>a <b>low level security model</b> allowing restrictions to be placed on tables, 
    rows and fields.</li>
  </ul>
  </li> 
</ul>
<P>
  Melati's design builds on our experience with previous systems we have deployed 
  successfully on a number of commercial sites: we feel that it enables a particularly 
  elegant and productive way of working. </P>
