<!-- ************** -->
      Introduction
<!-- ************** -->
</H2>

<P>
  At present, Melati <I>qua</I> web application library is quite closely tied
  to WebMacro (although POEM is not).  In future, however, we want to use
  JTemplater.  The changeover seems a good opportunity to reassess the
  interaction between Melati, POEM and the templating subsystem, and to make it
  a little more abstract so that we can allow people to change between (say)
  WebMacro and JTemplater with as little fuss as possible.
</P>

<P>
  Melati currently does the following jobs relating to WebMacro:

<!-- =================================== -->
      Enhancement of <TT>WMServlet</TT>
<!-- =================================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  This is what <TT>MelatiServlet</TT> and its parent <TT>MelatiWMServlet</TT>
  do: (There is no real point to the separation; it's just that the latter is
  a hacked version of <TT>WMServlet</TT>.)
</P>

    <P>
      Optional buffering of template expansion in <TT>expand</TT>, in order to

  <LI>
    <P>
      Connection to POEM <TT>Database</TT> and establishment of POEM session
    </P>
</UL>

<P>
  These are all things we will still want to provide, but independently of
  WebMacro.  <FONT COLOR=red>What should <TT>MelatiServlet</TT> look like,
  then?</FONT>
</P>



<H3>
<!-- =============================== -->
      Extraction of current object 
<!-- =============================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  This is done between <TT>Melati</TT> and
  <TT>MelatiServlet.melatiContext</TT>.  It's useful to structure many web
  applications around the notion of "the object on which the present HTTP
  request is operating, and the action we want to do with it".
</P>



<H3>
<!-- =================================== -->
      Enhancement of variable expansion
<!-- =================================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  This is what our hacked <TT>org.webmacro.engine.Variable</TT> does.
</P>

<P>
  <FONT COLOR=red>How does this relate to JTemplater?  Probably we want to
  provide two behaviours for JTemplater, at the level of the
  <TT>$(</TT>...<TT>)</TT> expression in which the exception occurs: just
  terminate expansion and throw the exception, or interpolate a representation
  the exception instead of the result of the expression.  But it would be nice
  if the latter could do some context-sensitive escaping.</FONT>

<!-- ========================= -->
      Markup language support
<!-- ========================= -->
</H3>

<P>
  This is what the <TT>*MarkupLanguage</TT> classes do:
</P>


<H4>
<!-- --------------- -->
      Text escaping
<!-- --------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Escaping ("rendering") of text according to the conventions of the
  language.  In fact there are several different kinds of escaping to
  be done in HTML, depending on the context:
</P>

<P>
  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=5>
    <TR>
      <TD>Doc body, attribute value</TD>
      <TD><TT>&amp;quot;</TT></TD>
    </TR>

      <TD>Javascript value</TD><TD><TT>\042</TT></TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>URL</TD><TD><TT>=22</TT></TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
 </P>



<H4>
<!-- --------------------- -->
      Exception rendering
<!-- --------------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Rendering of exceptions for display to the user, where the
  <TT>VariableExceptionHandler</TT> returns them to be displayed rather than
  simply throwing them out to terminate expansion.  Again, this is
  context-dependent:
</P>

<P>
  <TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=5>
    <TR>
      <TD>Doc body</TD>
      <TD><TT>&lt;I&gt;error!&lt;/I&gt;</TT></TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD>Attribute value (<I>e.g.</I>&nbsp;input box content)</TD>
      <TD><TT>[error!]</TT></TD>
    </TR>
  </TABLE>
</P>

<P>
  As of 21/07/2000, the representation of the exception is determined from a
  sub-template or &quot;templet&quot;.  The <TT>MarkupLanguage</TT> tries to
  load a WebMacro template (through the servlet's <TT>Broker</TT>) from a
  directory named after the markup language.  The filename of the template is
  taken at first to be the package-qualified class name of the exception with
  <TT>.wm</TT> appended; if that doesn't exist, it tries the superclass, and so
  on until it finds <TT>java.lang.Exception.wm</TT>, which just does
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
[$ml.rendered($exception.toString())]
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  The templet is expanded to a string against a specially constructed
  <TT>Context</TT>, and the string is returned to WebMacro for interpolation
  into the parent template.  <FONT COLOR=red>It would obviously be nice if the
  templet could be expanded directly to the output stream, so that the extra
  buffering could be avoided.</FONT>
</P>



<H3>
<!-- ====================== -->
      Smart field handling
<!-- ====================== -->
</H3>


<H4>
<!-- -------------------------- -->
      <TT>Field</TT> rendering
<!-- -------------------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Rendering of POEM <TT>Field</TT>s, <I>i.e.</I>&nbsp;values wrapped up with
  <TT>PoemType</TT>s, for display.  <FONT COLOR=red>(N.B.&nbsp;do we need a
  <TT>PoemTypedValue</TT> which is like a <TT>Field</TT> but doesn't have a
  name?  The name isn't needed here, only for rendering input controls.)</FONT>
</P>

<P>
  The functionality is: compute the field's localised &#145;cooked string&#146;
  representation; size-limit it; escape it for the doc-body context.
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>
    <P>
      Exceptions are caught and passed to <TT>VariableExceptionHandler</TT> set
      up in the expansion context, which can throw them out or return them to
      be rendered for the doc-body context as above.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      The locale is set up when the <TT>MarkupLanguage</TT> is constructed:
      at present it's always &#145;UK&#146;.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      There are different variants for calling up <TT>SHORT</TT>,
      <TT>MEDIUM</TT>, <TT>LONG</TT> and <TT>FULL</TT> styles.  This is really
      intended for use on dates.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      The size limit is generally 10M, and is only meant to prevent
      out-of-memory errors.  There is a variant which limits to 50&nbsp;chars,
      for &#145;short displays&#146; such as the admin system browse lists.
    </P>
</UL>


<H4>
<!-- ------------------------------- -->
      <TT>Persistent</TT> rendering
<!-- ------------------------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Rendering of POEM <TT>Persistent</TT>s, which just means calling up their
  localised <TT>displayString</TT> and rendering that in the doc-body context.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- ------------------------- -->
      Input control rendering
<!-- ------------------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Rendering of an input box, dropdown, <I>etc.</I> appropriate for entering the
  value of a POEM <TT>Field</TT>.  This has always used a &#145;templet&#146;
  mechanism similar to that used for exceptions: a markup language-specific
  directory is searched for a templet named after the <TT>PoemType</TT> of the
  field, except that the templet name can also be set explicitly in the field's
  <TT>getRenderInfo</TT> property (ultimately, in the admin interface).
</P>

<P>
  The name of the field is prefixed with <TT>field_</TT><FONT COLOR=red> (the
  prefixing is done in each templet individually, which doesn't seem
  right)</FONT>.  When the returning form is interpreted,
  <TT>Melati.extractFields</TT> knows to put that prefix on the field names of
  the <TT>Persistent</TT> into which things are going.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- ---------------------- -->
      General observations
<!-- ---------------------- -->
</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>
    <P>
      The decision as to how to render a given object is done in a strangely
      mixed way.  <TT>rendered(Field)</TT> is chosen by WebMacro's
      introspection mechanism, but everything else falls into
      <TT>rendered(Object)</TT>, where an <TT>instanceof</TT> dispatch decides
      what to do.  Probably it's best to do everything by the former mechanism
      (or even better by static method selection according to signature in the
      case of JTemplater), and disallow the rendering of arbitrary
      <TT>Object</TT>s using <TT>toString</TT>.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      Probably the display of everything should be delegated to markup
      language-specific templets, not just <TT>Exception</TT>s and
      <TT>Field</TT>s.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      &#145;What are we rendering&#146; and &#145;what context are we rendering
      in&#146; are essentially orthogonal considerations.  This is actually
      handled quite well in the current implementation, where
      <TT>HTMLMarkupLanguage</TT> will give you an
      <TT>AttributeHTMLMarkupLanguage</TT> as one of its properties.  However,
      the most tricky situations, such as that in which one is rendering a
      JavaScript expression containing a value in quotes will which eventually
      become part of the document body, may not be adequately covered.
    </P>

<H2>
<!-- **************************************** -->
      Desirable features for cleaner version
<!-- **************************************** -->
</H2>

<P>
  The idea of making &#145;Melati&#146; essentially a utility object
  (<TT>$melati</TT>) accessible within templates still seems a good one.
  However,
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>
    <P>
      It shouldn't care which templating mechanism is being used.  The same
      abstract logic should work with WebMacro and JTemplater.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      It should be capable, where possible, of rendering complex objects
      directly to the output stream rather than returning a string for
      interpolation.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      It should be simpler.  There are rather a lot of &#145;here's one I
      found handy once&#146; methods floating around.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      It should make it more obvious how to create a <TT>$melati</TT> object
      from outside a <TT>MelatiServlet</TT>.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      It should bring out more clearly the notions of expansion context and
      raw/cooked representation.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      It should make the &#145;current object&#146; feature a bit more
      optional.  In particular the logical database should probably be
      configurable in a <TT>.properties</TT> file.
    </P>
  <LI>
    <P>
      It should make it easy to say &#145;make me a dropdown&#146; without
      having to know what a <TT>Field</TT> is.
    </P>
</UL>

<P>
  Generalising from that last point,
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>
    <P>
      It should have a three-level stack of methods for value and input-control
      rendering, operating at the level of the <TT>Persistent</TT>, the
      <TT>Field</TT> and entirely non-POEM objects.  These should be isolated
      into separate classes so that the templets mechanism can be compiled
      independently of POEM.
