This functionality was broken in webmacro 2.0.RC1 and now outputs to a
String before splurting the whole thing to the browser.
</p>
<p>
This servlet uses org.melati.util.Flusher to ensure the output 
is flushed to the client every 2 seconds.
</p>
<p>
In some situations, such as a long running process, you want to keep the
underlying http request going, without it timing out,
you also want to be able to update the user as to progress.
</p>
#if ($melati.Method != "unflushed") #begin
<p>To see what would happen if you did not flush, click <a href=unflushed>here</a> (remember to wait :)</p>
#end #else #begin
<p>To see what would happen if you did flush, click <a href=flushed>here</a></p>
#end
<h3>Your Database has the following tables:</h3>
#set $wait = 1500
<p>There is a $(wait)ms delay between each table name being displayed</p>
#foreach $tab in $melati.Database.DisplayTables #begin
  $tab.DisplayName<br>
  $waiter.wait($wait)
#end
</body>
