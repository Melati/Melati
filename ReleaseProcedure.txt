Hello,

The scripts in this directory provide a means of building melati 
and poem using Ant. 

The original ant script was written by kimptoc@techie.com.

HOW TO USE

You need the latest version of ant (1.5.1).

If you just type ant you will be given a list of available options. 

To build a distributable copy of Melati just type:

ant build

It will create a directory
   .../dist/ in which the distribution is created.

To run the Melati site on the jetty webserver type:

ant run 

and point your browser at http://localhost:8080/

or to do both just type:

ant go

Once you have the scripts working there are a few things you should do
to create a release:

1.  Change the version number in build.xml
2.  If your change requires upgrade action by the user make a note
    in the Upgrading section of melati/README.html

4.  Add a paragraph about this release to melati/site/Releases.html
5.  Replace Release paragraph with one above in
    melati/site/Download.html
6.  CVS commit all of the above
7.  CVS tag this release (cvs tag Melati-0-6-1)
8.  Build melati (again)
9.  Upload jars and zips to http://www.melati.org/
    scp dist/packaged/*.* www.melati.org:/home/apache/share/htdocs/melati/download/
10. Update website
    cd /inst/melati/org/melati 
    cvs update
