<H3>
<!-- ================= -->
      Melati and POEM
<!-- ================= -->
</H3>

<P>
  <A HREF="index.html">Melati</A> is an open source, Java-based
  infrastructure for the rapid and convenient development of web-based database
  applications.  This guide describes the API of Melati POEM (Persistent Object
  Engine For Melati): the layer which provides Melati with its object-oriented
  view of the underlying relational database.  POEM is, in fact, independent
  of the rest of Melati and could be used on its own in non-web applications.
</P>



<H3>
<!-- =================== -->
      Other information
<!-- =================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  See also the <A HREF=ODMGPoemUserGuide.html>POEM ODMG documentation</A>
  which provides an ODMG compliant interface to Postgres - using POEM to do 
  all the hard work.
</P>

<P>
  See also the <A HREF="/javadoc/index.html">javadoc documentation</A>
  for Melati's classes.  The key classes are:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI> <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Database.html"><TT>Database</TT></A></li>

<H3>
<!-- =========================== -->
      Anatomy of a POEM session
<!-- =========================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  The following fragment (see <A HREF="/src/org/melati/example/contacts/Search.java"><TT>Search.java</TT></A>)
  shows the general pattern in which POEM is used.  First, the
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Database.html"><TT>Database</TT></A>
  object is created and connected to the RDBMS using the standard JDBC
  &quot;URL&quot;, username, and password:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
final Database database = new PoemDatabase();
database.connect("jdbc:postgresql:williamc", "williamc", "*");
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  The details are stored and used to make as many independent JDBC
  <TT>Connection</TT>s as needed (so-called &quot;connection pooling&quot;).
</P>

<P>
  Next, a simple task is performed, namely setting the name of user number five
  to <I>William Chesters</I>:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
database.inSession(
    AccessToken.root,
    new PoemTask() {
      public void run() throws PoemException {
	User user5 = database.getUserTable().getUserObject(5);
	user5.setName("William Chesters");
      }
    });
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  <I>Why the <TT>new</TT> <TT>PoemTask</TT> business?</I> Every access to a
  Melati database must be made from inside a
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/PoemTask.html"><TT>PoemTask</TT></A>
  passed to the database's
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Database.html#inSession(org.melati.poem.AccessToken, org.melati.poem.PoemTask)">
    <TT>inSession</TT></A>
  method.  This is because everything done by the <TT>run()</TT> method you
  provide is carried out
</P>

<OL TYPE=a>
  <LI> with a specific set of access
       <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Capability.html"><TT>Capability</TT></A>s
       determined by your session's
       <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/AccessToken.html"><TT>AccessToken</TT></A>---the
       first argument to 
       <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Database.html#inSession"><TT>Database.inSession</TT></A>,
       and
  </LI>
  <LI> in the context of a single database transaction, which is implicitly
       committed at the end or rolled back if an exception is thrown.
  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
  In this example, the access token used is
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/AccessToken.html#root"><TT>root</TT></A>,
  which simply allows you to do anything; but most often the token will
  correspond to a particular
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/User.html"><TT>User</TT></A>, and
  Melati will make sure that your task cannot see/change any data to which the
  administrator has denied the user read/write access.  Furthermore, it will
  not see any changes to the database made by other tasks which may be running
  at the same time, unless it does an explicit
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/PoemThread.html#commit"><TT>commit</TT></A>
  or
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/PoemThread.html#commit"><TT>rollback</TT></A>.
  The upshot is that once you have set your task running, you do not
  have worry about or even mention permissions or transactions at all.
</P>

<P>
  Of course, when POEM is used as part of Melati, sessions are started
  automatically (by
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/servlet/PoemServlet.html#doConfiguredRequest(org.melati.Melati)"><TT>PoemServlet.doConfiguredRequest</TT></A>)
  with an appropriate access token, so Melati programmers never normally
  have to call <TT>inSession</TT>.
</P>

<P>
  <I>What is &quot;user number&nbsp;five&quot;</I>?  All records in a POEM
  database table must be uniquely identified by a so-called &quot;troid&quot;
  (for table row ID), <I>i.e.</I>, every table must have a integer primary key,
  or non-null uniquely indexed integer field.  Typically, the troid field is
  called <TT>id</TT>, but it need not be.  The call
  <TT>database.getUserTable().getUserObject(5)</TT> returns an object
  representing the record from the <TT>user</TT> table with troid&nbsp;5.
</P>

<P>
  <I>Where does the object's <TT>setName</TT> method come from?</I> Every POEM
  database must contain various tables whose properties are declared at
  (POEM's) compile time in the &quot;data structure definition&quot; (or DSD)
  <A HREF="/src/org/melati/poem/Poem.dsd><TT>Poem.dsd</TT></A>, 
  including <TT>user</TT>; the relevant excerpt is
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
table User {
  (primary) Integer id;
  String login (size = 20);
  String password (size = 20);
  String name (size = 60);
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
  The <A HREF="PoemPreproUserGuide.html">POEM preprocessor</A> turns this into boilerplate
  code which defines typed accessor methods like <TT>setName</TT> corresponding
  to the fields given in the DSD, and also ensures that the fields are present
  in the database when the application starts up (by creating them if
  necessary, or failing with an error message if an incompatibility is
  detected).  Programmers are free to write their own application-specific DSDs
  so that they can take advantage of type-safe methods and automatic
  initialisation, but it's not mandatory, since all tables and fields
  (including any in the RDBMS which are not predeclared in the DSD) are also
  available via generic accessors in which their names appear as string
  arguments.  In fact the example above could have been written as follows:
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
        ...
	Persistent user5 = database.getTable("user").getObject(5);
	user5.setValue("name", "William Chesters");
        ...
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>




<H2>
<!-- ************** -->
      The database
<!-- ************** -->
</H2>

<P>
  Part of POEM's job is to maintain rich type information about the columns
  present in the database, so that Melati knows how to present them on web
  pages, POEM itself can guarantee that the values stored in them will be valid
  according to fairly fine-grained criteria, and the preprocessor can import
  those types into Java at compile time for the benefit of the application
  programmer.
</P>



<H3>
<!-- ================================= -->
      How the database is represented
<!-- ================================= -->
</H3>

<P>
  POEM provides a tidy Java-style view of the database, with objects
  representing the database itself, its tables, and their columns and rows.
</P>


<H4>
<!-- -------------- -->
      The database
<!-- -------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Each <A
  HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Database.html"><TT>Database</TT></A>
  object corresponds to a single database (<I>i.e.</I> collection of tables) in
  the DBMS.  Its function is to act as a container for <A
  HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Table.html"><TT>Table</TT></A>s and as
  the carrier of POEM's top-level APIs.
</P>

<P>
  <TT>Database</TT> itself is an abstract class.  Each data structure
  definition file <TT><I>Bar</I>.dsd</TT> gives rise to an extension of
  <TT>Database</TT> called <TT><I>Bar</I>DatabaseBase</TT> containing
  boilerplate code for accessing the tables declared in the DSD in a type-safe
  way, and a blank subclass of that called <TT><I>Bar</I>Database</TT> to which
  you can add methods of your own.  It is <TT><I>Bar</I>Database</TT> that you
  should instantiate.  Or, if you are not working with a DSD-defined schema,
  you should instantiate <TT>PoemDatabase</TT> (which is actually derived from
  a DSD file called <A HREF=../melati-static/poem/Poem.dsd><TT>Poem.dsd</TT></A>).
</P>


<H4>
<!-- -------- -->
      Tables
<!-- -------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  Each <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Table.html"><TT>Table</TT></A>
  object represents a single table in the DBMS.  It acts as a container for the
  table's columns and provides methods for searching over and retrieval of the
  records in the table.
</P>

<P>
  Each declaration <TT>table</TT> <TT><I>Foo</I></TT> in the DSD gives rise to
  an extension of <TT>Table</TT> called <TT><I>Foo</I>TableBase</TT> containing
  boilerplate code to express the application-specific schema of the table in a
  type-safe way.
</P>



<H3>
<!-- =============================== -->
      How the database gets defined
<!-- =============================== -->
</H3>

<P>
  The type information stored by the RDBMS and provided through JDBC's
  <TT>DatabaseMetaData</TT> facility is not sufficient for POEM's purposes (the
  more so since not all RDBMSs can record referential relationships between
  columns).  So POEM synthesises the <TT>DatabaseMetaData</TT> with two other
  sources, one originating at compile time with the programmer and the other at
  run time with the database administrator.
</P>


<H4><A NAME=DSD></A>
<!-- ------------------------------- -->
      The Data Structure Definition
<!-- ------------------------------- -->
</H4>

<P>
  The programmer's contribution is called the Data Structure Definition or DSD.
  It takes the form of a single text file containing a series of table
  definitions each resembling a Java class definition---or, better, a C
  structure definition, since at this stage no methods can be specified.
  POEM's own builtin special tables are defined in this way in
  <A
    HREF="/src/org/melati/poem/Poem.dsd"><TT>org/melati/poem/Poem.dsd</TT></A>, 
  which makes a good example of a
  DSD; the file format is described in detail in the
  <A HREF="PoemPreproUserGuide.html">documentation</A> for the preprocessor which
  interprets them.
</P>

<P>
  The table definitions are mapped by the preprocessor onto a series of
  automatically generated Java class definitions, which do two things: they
  bring the names and (enriched) types of the database fields into the static
  Java type system, making the application-level programming clearer and less
  error-prone, and they carry initialisation code which checks that the
  database is consistent with the DSD each time the application is started up
  (and creates any tables and/or columns which are missing).  The programmer
  can subclass or otherwise use the typed Java representation of the database
  objects to build up the business logic of her system, letting POEM and the
  Java compiler do the work of ensuring that she is using the database in a
  consistent way and of creating and maintaining an appropriately structured
  schema in the RDBMS.
</P>


<H4><A NAME=metadataTables>
<!-- --------------------- -->
      The metadata tables
<!-- --------------------- -->
</A></H4>

<P>
  The second function of the DSD-derived code---to provide automatic creation
  and subsequent verification of the predefined parts of the database---is a
  convenient service for the programmer, but could prove irritating to the
  database administrator if it meant that she had to edit a text file and
  recompile the application every time she wanted to add a field, even one
  which wasn't used in any Java-coded application logic, or just change the
  default width of a text box.  So POEM stores its rich field-type information
  in special tables in the database itself, where it can be edited through a
  web interface (the <A 
  HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/admin/package-summary.html">generic admin system</A>).
</P>

<P>
  The <TT>tableinfo</TT> table describes the properties of each table in the
  database (including itself): its programmatic <TT>name</TT>, its
  <TT>displayname</TT> and <TT>displayorder</TT> (used by the Melati admin
  system), and the
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/Capability.html"><TT>Capability</TT></A>s
  required for reading and writing its rows (where not overridden in the rows
  themselves, or in the application Java code---see the
  <A HREF="#accessControl">discussion</A> of POEM's access control mechanism).
</P>

<P>
  The <TT>columninfo</TT> table describes the properties of each column in the
  database (including its own).  Like <TT>tableinfo</TT>s, <TT>columninfo</TT>s
  define a programmatic and a display name and a display order; in addition,
  they carry fields which jointly define the column's
  <A HREF="/javadoc/org/melati/poem/PoemType.html"><TT>PoemType</TT></A>.
</P>

<P>
  (Although there is in principle no reason why anyone should have to interact
  with these tables directly, a detailed description is provided
  <A HREF=Internals.html#metadataTables>in the POEM internals document</A>.)
