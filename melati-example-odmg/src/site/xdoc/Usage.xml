<section name="Using the CMS to create pages">
<p>
The Melati CMS enables you to create and maintain pages of a website 
through its database interface.
</p>
<p>
The website can be viewed as a tree with the home page as the root.
The tree view can be viewed by clicking the <b>tree</b> link on the top right  
frame of a <b>Page</b> record within the 
<a href="/db/Admin/wvm/Main">Admin System</a>.
</p>
<subsection name="Creating a new Page">
<p>
Before creating a new page you should have decided where you want 
the page to  appear in the website tree.
You should also have written the text, in notepad or similar text editor, 
though you can use the system to edit on the fly it is better to 
have written the text and reviewed it on paper before entering it 
in the system.
</p>
<p>
Access the <a href="/db/Admin/wvm/Main">Admin System</a>, where the 
Page Table is the first screen presented to you. 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the New Record icon <img src="/melati-static/admin/edit_file.gif"
alt="New Record Icon"/>.
</li>
<li>Fill in at least the <font color="red">Name</font>,
<font color="red">Display Name</font> and 
<font color="red">Display Order</font>.
For example <tt>example</tt>, <tt>Example</tt> and <tt>23</tt>.
[Leave the <font color="red">Deleted</font> box unchecked.]
</li>

<li>If you want the page to appear within the site then 
select a parent for it. 
</li>
<li>Select <tt>Default</tt> as the style.</li>
<li>Ignore the <tt>Template</tt> field.</li>
<li>Press <tt>Update</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>
You have created an empty page!
It can be viewed at <a href="http://wvm.paneris.org/db/Display/page/Example.html">http://wvm.paneris.org/db/Display/page/Example.html</a>.
</p>

<subsection name="Adding paragraphs (Divs)">
<p>
Use the Admin system to navigate to your newley created page.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Press the <tt>Div</tt> link on the top right pane.
</li>
<li>Click the New Record icon <img src="/melati-static/admin/edit_file.gif"
alt="New Record Icon"/>.
</li>
<li>
Enter a pagagraph number.
</li>
<li>
Select a Style (Default).
</li>
<li>
Add the paragraph title.
</li>
<li>
Enter the paragraph content.
</li>
<li>Press <tt>Update</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>
Repeat for as many paragraphs as you have for this Page.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="Creating non-standard pages">
<p>
The pages that you can create using the CMS are deliberately 
standardised, to give a uniform look and feel to the whole site which can be 
easily changed. 
However there is a requirement to be able to bypass 
this mechanism.
</p>
<p>
To create a page which does not fit into the standard framework 
follow the procedure above to create basic page.
Then save that page to your local disk and edit it with 
your HTML editor of choice.
</p>
<p>
Use the <a href="/db/Admin/wvm/Main">Admin System</a> to create a new 
Uploaded File record and upload your editted file.
</p>
<p>
This trick can be used to overwrite a page from the database, 
if there is a requirement for a non standard page.
</p>

<subsection name="Configuring contacts">
<p>
The emails sent by the system have the following configurable settings:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>WebsiteFromName</th>
<td>Ordinary name of sender</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>WebsiteFromEmail</th>
<td>Email of sender</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>SalesAdminName</th>
<td>Ordinary name of sales addressee</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>SalesAdminEmail</th>
<td>Email of sales addressee</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>NewsAdminName</th>
<td>Ordinary name of news addressee</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>NewsAdminEmail</th>
<td>Email of news addressee</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Use the Admin System to modify the 
<a href="/db/Admin/wvm/setting/Main">setting table</a>.
