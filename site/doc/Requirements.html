<H1><TT>org.melati</TT> Requirements Analysis (document $Revision$)</H1>

<P>
  This document provides an analysis of the requirements which the
  system is intended to meet.  See also the system's <A
  HREF=QA.html>master QA document</A>.
</P>


<H2>Background</H2>

  <H3>The customer</H3>

    <P>
      Melati is being developed to provide the infrastructure for the
      all future Paneris sites, and will hopefully be used by others
      when it is open-sourced.
    </P>

  <H3>Project genesis</H3>

    <P>
      The Melati project came to life out of discussions on the JAL
      messageboard.
    </P>


<H2>Business need</H2>

  <P>
    JAL (Java Application Layer) is a class library layer which
    mediates between a relational database---currently Postgres---and
    webmacro controllers and templates, encapsulating database table
    rows as objects which handle tasks such as resolving linked
    records and generating HTML input fields semi-transparently.  It
    also offers a comprehensive administration system for any database
    whose schema adheres to certain idioms, without further
    customisation.  The present implementation of JAL is held to
    suffer from

    <UL>
      <LI> lack of clarity, both in its overall structure and in its
           line-by-line coding, arising from its status as a prototype
           which was developed quickly as a way of discovering what
           functionality would turn out to be useful
      <LI> failure to take advantage of the Java type system: table
           rows look like (and in fact are) <TT>Hashtable</TT>s
      <LI> inability to support cacheing of data in the Java process
           in a way which guarantees consistency when used in
           combination with SQL transactions
    </UL>

    It is felt that rewriting JAL in a way which preserves its
    strengths while eliminating these weaknesses will yield a more
    maintainable product, and shorten the development cycle of
    projects which use it.
  </P>


<H2>Users</H2>

  <P>
    The users who are going to interact with the system fall into the
    following classes:
  </P>

  <P>
    <B>Paneris programmers.</B> Paneris programmers will use Melati as
    the core infrastructure for constructing most if not all of their
    customers' web sites.
  </P>

  <P>
    <B>The open source community.</B> It is hoped that Melati will
    become popular among open-source developers outside Paneris.  This
    will bring Paneris the familiar benefits of `free' debugging and
    further development, and, to Paneris's customers, the reassurance
    of (free) dual-sourcing.
  </P>

  <P>
    <B>Customers' end users.</B> End users will interact directly with
    Melati, as they do with JAL, through its login screen (part of the
    <A NAME=#access>access control facility</A>).
  </P>

  <P>
    <B>Customers' site administrators.</B> Melati will preserve JAL's
    very powerful generic database administration system, which allows
    all but the most domain-specific administration tasks to be
    carried out remotely through a web interface.
  </P>

  <P>
    <B>Customers' installers.</B> These are the people who install
    Melati-based software on a fresh machine.
  </P>


<H2>Services</H2>

  <P>
    The services the system will offer its users are:
  </P>

  <H3>Paneris programmers</H3>

    <A NAME=structuredef><H4>Data structure definition</H4></A>

      <P>
        A facility for defining the database schema, including linked
        fields (`one to one' and `one to many' relationships) and
        field display preferences, in a convenient notation perhaps
        similar to that of Java class definitions.  It is important
        that this should be treated as a minimum definition:
        administrators should be able to add other tables and fields,
        so that they can be used in templates and the generic
        administration system, directly over the web interface.
      </P>

      <P>
        In the long run, it might be nice to allow inheritance
        relationships between tables to be supported automatically
        (but not by exploiting the Postgres inheritance facility, for
        portability reasons).
      </P>

    <H4>`Persistent object' mechanism</H4>

      <P>
        Database objects returned to the programmer via the Melati API
        should appear to her as Java objects with type-safe get/set
        method pairs corresponding to the fields given in the <A
        HREF=#structuredef>data structure definition</A>.  All fields,
        including extra ones defined dynamically by administrators
        <I>etc.</I>, should also be accessible by their (string)
        names, to facilitate the writing of generic code; in
        particular, it must be possible to iterate over a persistent
        object's fields in a webmacro template (<I>e.g.</I> that for
        a generic data entry screen).
      </P>

    <H4>Object specialisation</H4>

      <P>
        The programmer should be able to add domain-specific
        `convenience methods' to the bare persistent objects.
      </P>

    <H4>Retrieval and searching</H4>

      <P>
        Explicit retrieval of linked records should not be necessary:
        the programmer should be able to treat the records as normally
        linked Java objects.
      </P>

      <P>
        The API should provide for any kind of search to be performed,
        if necessary by means of arbitrary <TT>WHERE</TT> clauses.
        The special case of retrieval by a canonical ID field should
        be made trivial (but it must not be a necessary that this
        field is actually called <TT>id</TT>).
      </P>

      <P>
        In general, the basic unit of retrieval should be the
        record/object.  However, it must be possible to execute
        arbitrary SQL <TT>SELECT</TT>s returning a selective join of
        fields---on the understanding that this will bypass the cache.
      </P>

      <P>
        It may also be worth thinking about providing an API for
        retrieving only some of only some of an object's fields (the
        remainder being fetched on demand), and, conversely, for
        pre-fetching linked objects using a single call to the
        backend.
      </P>

    <H4>Transactions</H4>

      <P>
        At least a simple kind of `transactional' capability must be provided:
        <I>e.g.</I> commit/rollback of all changes made to the database during
        the processing of a particular HTTP request.
      </P>

    <A NAME=cacheing><H4>Cacheing</H4></A>

      <P>
        The programmer should be able to control the manner in which
        Melati caches data from the RDBMS: provisionally, the maximum
        size of the cache for each table, and perhaps whether the
        results of each individual operation which might trigger a
        <TT>SELECT</TT> should be cached.
      </P>

      <P>
        The cacheing mechanism must interact consistently with SQL
	transactions.  If a cached row is changed through a
	non-autocommitting connection, the change must be visible
	through that connection only, and must revert correctly if the
	transaction is rolled back.
      </P>

    <A NAME=i18n><H4>Internationalisation</H4></A>

      <P>
        Melati should provide support for convenient
        internationalisation: language-specific table columns should
        be localised transparently or semi-transparently.
      </P>

    <A NAME=access><H4>Access control</H4></A>

      <P>
        It must be possible to enforce restrictions which ensure that
        only groups of named users (as determined by knowledge of a
        password to go with their username) are able to access certain
        services, defined on a per-record basis, on a Melati-based site.
        For the programmer's convenience and to avoid security bugs
        creeping in due to programmer oversight, the checks
        implementing access control should be made as close to the
        data as possible, so that in principle all she has to worry
        about is passing in the right `user' object or authentication
        token (once only).  There should also be a way for her to
        perform specific checks of her own if she wishes to catch
        authentication-failure situations before wasting any of the
        user's time.
      </P>

      <P>
        For similar reasons of convenience and robustness, Melati should
        allow the programmer to define access control
        <I>policies</I>---for instance, one to the effect that an
        invoice should be visible both to its issuing party and to its
        receiving party.  (But arbitrary, per-row permissions setting
        must still be possible for the administrator.)
      </P>

      <P>
        The system should support the definition of user groups (and
        of group-groups, <I>etc.</I>) for use in authentication
        rules.
      </P>

      <P>
        Basic access levels to table records should include `none',
        `read only' and `read-write'.
      </P>

    <H4>Markup generation for templates</H4>

      <P>
        There should be a simple and unintrusive way of placing markup
        implementing views of and data entry fields for objects in a
        webmacro template, and of reading fields back into objects
        when they return from the user.
      </P>

      <P>
        This facility should be markup-language neutral, so that we
        can as a minimum write templates in any of HTML, XML and WML.
      </P>

      <P>
        Javascript validation checks should be added automatically or
        semi-automatically to input fields where appropriate.
      </P>

  <H3>The open source community</H3>

    <P>
      The services provided for Paneris programmers must be
      sufficiently accessible---easy to grasp, convenient to use, well
      documented---for people from the wider open source community to
      want to use them too.
    </P>

  <H3>End users</H3>

    <H4>Login</H4>

      <P>
        End users must be able to log in to Melati-based sites for
        authentication purposes, either on demand (when they attempt
        to do something for which authentication is required) or
        explicitly.  They should also be able to logout or re-login
        under a different username at any time.  It would be nice if
        they had the option of storing their logged-in-ness across
        browser sessions in (<I>e.g.</I>) a cookie (but cookies must
        not be forced on them).
      </P>

    <H4>Password management</H4>

      <P>
        Melati must provide a facility for reminding users of their
        password, by some <A HREF=#security_quite>reasonably secure</A>
        means, if they have forgotten it, and allow them to change it
        at will.
      </P>

  <H3>Administrators</H3>

    <H4>Database viewing/editing</H4>

      <P>
        Melati must support the functionality of JAL's current generic
        administration system: briefly,

        <UL>
          <LI> list tables
          <LI> add/delete tables
          <LI> list records in a table matching a template
          <LI> add/edit/delete a record
          <LI> list records linked to (or linking to) a record
          <LI> change the capabilities required to read/write a record
        </UL>
      </P>

      <P>
        For an example of JAL's admin system in action, see:
        <A HREF="http://paneris.org/webmacro/org.paneris.jal.controller.Admin?db=paneris&action=tables"><TT>http://paneris.org/webmacro/org.paneris.jal.controller.Admin?db=paneris&action=tables</TT></A>
      </P>

    <H4>Localisation</H4>

      <P>
        The admin system should support localisation of an <A
        HREF=#i18n>internationalised</A> database in some convenient
        form.
      </P>

  <H3>Installers</H3>

    <H4>Database creation/validation</H4>

      <P>
        At the request of the installer, a Melati-based site should be
        able to (re-)create and initialise a fresh database so that
        this doesn't have to be done manually.
      </P>

      <P>
        When a Melati-based site starts up, it should be able to verify
        that the database schema in the RDBMS is safely consistent
        with the program's <A HREF=#structuredef>idea</A> of what
        should be there, and fail with an error message if it isn't.
      </P>


<H2>Constraints</H2>

  <A NAME=platform><H3>Platform</H3></A>

    <P>
      Melati is targetted to run on a Linux machine (2.2 and up) as a
      Java process (1.1.7 and up) using Postgres as a backend RDBMS
      (6.5 and up) and webmacro for the templates.  We should feel
      confident that we can replace Postgres with any other
      full-featured SQL RDBMS for all Melati-based sites inside a week
      at most.  For the benefit of the wider open-source community,
      it's important that Melati should ultimately be portable to
      NT4/W2K plus SQL Server (for developers as well as for running
      live sites).
    </P>

    <P>
      It is acceptable that no other processes should be allowed write
      access to the database in the backend RDBMS while Melati is using
      it (apart from those run by hacker-administrators who know what
      they are doing; without this restriction, <A
      HREF=#cacheing>cacheing</A> makes no sense, and Melati will have
      continually to check that the database schema is not changing
      under its feet).
    </P>

  <A NAME=performance><H3>Performance</H3></A>

    <P>
      Melati-based sites should be able to handle HTTP requests for
      simple templates including linked records at a rate of twenty
      hits per second.  This should suffice for all applications
      except heavy-duty ones for which the tradeoff point between
      development effort/maintainability and implementation
      simplicity/speed falls unusually far towards the latter.
    </P>

  <A NAME=security><H3>Security</H3></A>

    <P>
      Melati-based sites should offer <A NAME=security_quite>reasonable
      security</A>: we should feel happy about allowing it to control
      access to user preferences, messageboards <I>etc.</I>, but
      facilities for spending money and deeply private information
      will have to be protected by an external mechanism.
    </P>

  <A NAME=robustness><H3>Robustness</H3></A>

    <P>
      Given the consistency of Melati's <A HREF=#cacheing>cacheing</A>
      mechanism, and low-level data integrity checks, the site's
      robustness should be limited only by that of the RDBMS, and of
      course the site-specific code.
    </P>

    <P>
      We may want to look into running a watchdog process which
      restarts <TT>httpd</TT> and everything else every minute or two
      if the system fails a test transaction, and sends a warning
      email or whatever.
    </P>

  <A NAME=stability><H3>Stability</H3></A>

    <P>
      It should be very surprising and worrying for a
      Melati/Postgres/Linux site to go down.
    </P>


<H2>Risk analysis</H2>

  <P>
    It's unlikely that the requirements proposed in the present
    document, once reviewed, will turn out to be seriously wrong,
    because JAL and the sites developed using it provide an excellent
    case study of what is needed and what can in practice be
    supported.
  </P>

  <P>
    The main doubt relates to the <A HREF=#structuredef>data structure
    definition</A>: it may be that a simple `language' turns out to be
    too inflexible to map onto the kind of <TT>CREATE</TT>
    <TT>TABLE</TT> we need in complicated cases.
  </P>
